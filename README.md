# üìä Truster

> A Study of C, Go, Rust, Julia, TypeScript, and Python Performance

## üìù Overview

This repo houses scripts and resources for a thorough examination of performance characteristics across programming languages including C, Go, Rust, Julia, TypeScript, and Python. Our primary aim is to analyze and compare execution speed and other relevant performance metrics in various scenarios.

## üìÇ Contents

1. [**benches**](./benches): This directory contains source code benchmark files written in each of the studied programming languages. Each language has its file/subdirectory within `benches`.

1. [**plots**](./plots): The results obtained from the performance analysis are stored in this directory. It includes data files, charts, and reports summarizing the findings of the study.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Fork and clone the repository to your local machine:

	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/truster.git
	```

1. Navigate to the repository directory:

	```sh
	cd truster
	```

1. Explore the source code in the [`benches`](./benches) directory to understand the implementations in each programming language.

1. Run the scripts measure performance metrics.

1. Analyze the results stored in the [`plots`](./plots) directory to understand the performance characteristics of each language.

## üìä Results

After running the benchmarks and plotting the results, C fib algorithm had the fastest execution times, followed by Rust, Go, Julia, TypeScript, and Python.
